Standardization in Data Processing
Standardization is the process of transforming data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that different features have comparable scales, improving the performance of machine learning models, especially those that rely on distance-based calculations like KNN, SVM, and linear regression.
Why Standardization?
Improves Model Performance: Some machine learning models, especially those based on gradient descent, converge faster when data is standardized.
Prevents Feature Dominance: Features with larger scales (e.g., salary in thousands vs. age in years) might dominate models if not standardized.
Works Well with Regularization: Algorithms like Ridge and Lasso regression perform better when data is standardized.
When to Use Standardization?
When features have different units or scales.
When using algorithms that are sensitive to feature magnitudes (e.g., PCA, logistic regression, neural networks).
When improving the stability of optimization processes.
When Not to Use Standardization?
When the dataset is already normalized or in the same range.
When working with tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees) that are not affected by scale.
